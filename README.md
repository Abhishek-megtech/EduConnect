# EduConnect
Created with CodeSandbox

By Abhishek A Pillai, Waylen Barreto, Karthik Sheregar

EduConnect is our first website, created as part of our lenovo internship project to explore web development and educational solutions. While it is not a fully functioning platform, it demonstrates our efforts to design a responsive web interface aimed at bridging educational gaps in rural Goa, aligned with SDG 4 â€“ Quality Education.

Highlights:

Resource Hub Layout: Designed pages for study materials and notes.

Mentorship Section: Conceptualized a volunteer mentorship interface.

Career Guidance: Designed career guidance sections for students.

Responsive Design: Ensured the website layout adapts to different devices.

This project showcases our first experience in web development and our initiative to create digital solutions for real-world educational challenges
